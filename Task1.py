#Explaination : 
# This Python script is a weather forecasting tool that fetches real-time data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
# It visualizes temperature and humidity trends for the next 24 hours in Mumbai using data science libraries.
# The script begins by setting up the API key and constructing a URL with metric units for clarity.
# The get_weather_data() function sends a GET request to the API and returns the JSON response if successful.
# If the request fails, it prints an error message to help users debug connectivity or API issues.
# The process_weather_data() function extracts timestamps, temperatures, and humidity levels from the first 24 forecast entries.
# These entries represent 3-hour intervals, covering a full day of weather predictions in a structured format.
# The extracted data is converted into a Pandas DataFrame, enabling easy manipulation and analysis of trends.
# This structured format allows for efficient plotting and statistical operations using Python‚Äôs data science ecosystem.
# The create_visualizations() function uses Seaborn and Matplotlib to generate two line plots for clarity and insight.
# One plot shows temperature trends, and the other visualizes humidity levels, both plotted against time intervals.
# The plots are styled with gridlines, labeled axes, and rotated x-ticks to enhance readability and presentation.
# Each visualization is saved as a PNG image before being displayed, making it easy to share or archive.
# The entire script is wrapped in a main() function that orchestrates the data fetching, processing, and plotting.
# It runs only when executed directly, ensuring modularity and preventing unintended execution during imports or testing.
# When the script is run, it produces clean and informative visualizations of Mumbai‚Äôs weather for the next 24 hours.
# This allows users to quickly understand temperature and humidity patterns and plan their day accordingly.
# The modular design makes it easy to adapt the script for other cities or add new weather metrics.
# You could extend it to include wind speed, precipitation, or even air quality using additional API endpoints.
# Overall, the script demonstrates how to integrate API data with Python‚Äôs data science libraries effectively.
# It‚Äôs a great example of building a useful and visually appealing real-world application with minimal complexity.
# For someone like you, Ronak, who blends technical skill with creative storytelling, this tool is a perfect showcase.
# You could enhance it by adding interactive dashboards using Plotly or deploying it as a web app with Flask.
# Embedding logos, customizing color palettes, or exporting reports as PDFs would add polish and professional appeal.
# This kind of project is ideal for internships, academic submissions, or startup demos where clarity matters most.
# It highlights your ability to turn raw data into actionable insights with clean code and thoughtful design.
# Whether you're presenting to a client, refining your portfolio, or just practicing Python, this tool stands out.
# It‚Äôs practical, impressive, and a strong foundation for more advanced weather analytics or data-driven storytelling.
