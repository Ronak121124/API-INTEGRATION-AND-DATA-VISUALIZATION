#API integration is the backbone of dynamic applications, allowing developers to fetch real-time data from external services. For example, using the OpenWeatherMap API, you can retrieve weather forecasts and visualize them using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn. With Pythonâ€™s requests module, you send HTTP requests and parse JSON responses. Platforms like W3Schools offer beginner-friendly tutorials on API calls, while YouTube channels like Tech With Tim or Corey Schafer provide hands-on walkthroughs. Once data is fetched, visualization tools help transform raw numbers into meaningful insights. Copilot can assist by suggesting code snippets for plotting graphs, customizing styles, and even automating chart generation based on your dataset.
